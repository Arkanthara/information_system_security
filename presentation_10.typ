= Deepfake 

Use Neural Network to generate fake videos

- opinion manipulation
- destroy reputation
- visual imitation

== Generative adversarial Networks

Generator generate some data
Discriminator describe how much data are far away from reality
Goal: create realistic fake data

- images
- audio
- video

== Preventive methods

- glitch in videos
- problems with some transition (rotating objects, fast moves, ...)
- problems with background audio
- watermark

== Good practices

- Check sources
- Form employees
- Inform peoples to this kind of attacks
- develop a good mind to systematically verify sources
