Rainbow table: table with password and hash

Reduction function give password from hash

We can make several time password -> hash -> reduction -> hash -> ... before storing the password...

### Prevent retrieval password...

- Salt in hashfunction: add salt in hash function that modifies digest result... So hash doesn't depend only of the message, but also from the salt...

- Prevent attack: make a million of hash of the password -> take time to brute force password...

# Presentation 3

RSA based on primary number factorization.

Shor algorithm: quantum probabilistic with polynomial complexity that factorize big numbers

quantum bytes: is represented by state

quantum gates: operations that change state of qubits (always unitary -> matrix!)
