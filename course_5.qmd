# Random Oracle

I have this box, I must have different cypher for a given plaintext, else pattern matching etc...

Random oracle is deterministic with previously processed inputs...

Adversary has capability of questions to oracle...

Complexify things to hacker 

# One time pad

System unconditionnaly safe

If same key is reused, by making xor between cyphers give xor between messages !!!

# Steganography

Easily breakable...

# Symetric cryptography

## Stream ciphers

It's bad brother.... Because we go quickly to easy decription case....

A single key generate the keystream
Then we substitue plaintext by operation with key...

## Caracteristics

- efficient
- easy
- less memory needed
- error propagation limited

INCONVENIENTS:

- randomness quality of keytream
- reusability of keystream allow an easy cryptanalyse (like one-time-pad)

## Block ciphers
