MDCs... NOt important... Only Customized MDCs !

Blockchain: keep time constant: around 10 minutes to mine one block...

Password storage: execute hash 100000 times.../add salt to the password/

= Digital signatures

signature with appendix: hash signed...
signature with reconstitution: entire message signed...

Blind signature with RSA: m dot k^e -> signed (m dot k^e)^d = m^d k^(ed) so only need to divide per k to get m^d !
