#### Original version

* **Confidentiality**: Protection of information from unauthorized disclosure.
* **Integrity**: Protection against unauthorized modification of information.
* **Availability**: Ensuring that resources are accessible to legitimate users.
* **Authentication**:

  * **Entity authentication** *(entity authentication)*: Process allowing one entity to be certain of the identity of a second entity, supported by corroborating evidence (e.g., physical presence, cryptographic, biometric, etc.). The term identification is sometimes also used for this service.
  * **Data origin authentication** *(data origin authentication)*: Process allowing one entity to be certain that a second entity is the original source of a set of data. By definition, this service also ensures the integrity of the data.
* **Non-repudiation**: Guarantees that an entity cannot deny being involved in a transaction.
* **Non-duplication**: Protection against illicit copying.
* **Anonymity (entity or data origin)**: Preserves the identity of an entity, the source of information, or a transaction.
