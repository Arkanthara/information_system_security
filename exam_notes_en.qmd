#### Original version

* **Confidentiality**: Protection of information from unauthorized disclosure.
* **Integrity**: Protection against unauthorized modification of information.
* **Availability**: Ensuring that resources are accessible to legitimate users.
* **Authentication**:

  * **Entity authentication** *(entity authentication)*: Process allowing one entity to be certain of the identity of a second entity, supported by corroborating evidence (e.g., physical presence, cryptographic, biometric, etc.). The term identification is sometimes also used for this service.
  * **Data origin authentication** *(data origin authentication)*: Process allowing one entity to be certain that a second entity is the original source of a set of data. By definition, this service also ensures the integrity of the data.
* **Non-repudiation**: Guarantees that an entity cannot deny being involved in a transaction.
* **Non-duplication**: Protection against illicit copying.
* **Anonymity (entity or data origin)**: Preserves the identity of an entity, the source of information, or a transaction.

* It is virtually impossible to retrieve the source document using only the digest (**one-way**).
* It is virtually impossible to find a second source document producing the same digest (**collision-free**).
* Usual digest length: 160 to 512 bits.
* One-way algorithms are very performant.
* Examples: SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-3, etc.

* **Characteristics**
    * **random**
    * **unpredictable**
    * **non-reproducible**
* **Critical** for security (keys, IV, secrets).
* **Types**:
  - **True random**: based on physical phenomena (radioactivity, quantum).
  - **Pseudo-random**: deterministic (based on a *seed*: initial random sequence).
* **Risk**: "Pseudo-security" if the *seed* is predictable (Pitkin quote).
* Applications: session keys, IV (DES-CBC), signatures (ElGamal).

::: {.callout collapse="true"}

::: {.callout collapse="true"}
#### Original version

* Random number generation is a very important process that can compromise the security of many encryption systems.
* Applications: session key generation, initialization vectors (DES - CBC mode), secrets for signatures (ElGamal), etc.
* A **random generator** is a device capable of generating numbers in a **random**, **unpredictable** and **non-reproducible** way. (e.g. based on physical phenomena: radioactive or quantum source).
* **Pseudo-random generators** are deterministic processes developed from an initial random sequence (**seed**) (e.g. user keystrokes, disk access).
* *Quote:* R. Pitkin in [Kau95]: "The use of pseudo-random processes to generate secret quantities can result in pseudo-security"
:::

## Symmetric Cryptography

* **History**: Used since Julius Caesar (1st century BC).
* **Principle**: A single key for encryption/decryption.
* **Scheme**: Plaintext → Encryption (Key) → Ciphertext → Decryption (Key) → Plaintext.
* **Characteristics**:
  - Algorithms: AES, DES, IDEA, RC4.
  - Services: Confidentiality, Authentication, Integrity.
  - **Limit**: No signatures (shared key).
  - **Problem**: Secure key exchange required.

::: {.callout collapse="true"}
#### Ultra-summary
- **1 key** to encrypt/decrypt.
- **Fast** (AES, DES).
- **Problem**: key exchange.
- Uses: personal documents, closed groups.
:::

::: {.callout collapse="true"}
#### Original version

* Also called conventional cryptography or secret key cryptography (1st century BC, Julius Caesar).
* **Idea:** Based on a single secret key, perform a transformation capable of respectively making information unreadable and restoring it.
* **Scheme:** Plaintext $\to$ Encryption (Key) $\to$ Ciphertext $\to$ Decryption (Key) $\to$ Plaintext.
* **Characteristics:**
    * Algorithms: AES, DES, IDEA, RC4, RC5, etc. (some are free and openly available)
    * Services: Confidentiality, Authentication, Integrity.
    * No direct support for digital signatures (because key known by both).
    * Requires a confidential channel to exchange the key.
    * Ideal for protection of personal documents or closed groups.
:::

---

## Asymmetric Cryptography

* Also called **public cryptography** (1976, Diffie & Hellman).
* **Principle**
    - Key pair (public/private) for encryption and signatures.
* **Two main uses**:
  1. **Confidentiality**:
     - Encryption: recipient's public key
     - Decryption: recipient's private key
  2. **Digital signature**:
     - Signature: sender's private key
     - Verification: sender's public key
     - *Optimization*: Generally sign the **hash** of the document
     - **Fundamental properties**:
       - **Integrity**: Any modification invalidates the signature
       - **Non-collision**: Impossible to have 2 documents with the same signature
       - **Non-repudiation**: Only the holder of the private key can sign

* **Technical aspects**:
  - **Algorithms**: RSA, ElGamal
  - **Services**: Integrity, Authentication, Non-Repudiation
  - **Performance**: much slower than symmetric (100x slower)
  - **Advantage**: No need for a confidential channel for key exchange

::: {.callout collapse="true"}
#### Ultra-summary
- **2 keys**: public (encrypt/verify) + private (decrypt/sign)
- **2 uses**:
  - Confidentiality: encrypt for a recipient
  - Signature: prove authenticity
- **Signatures**:
  - Integrity + non-repudiation
- **Algorithms**: RSA/ElGamal
- **Advantage**: No need for secure channel to exchange keys
- **Disadvantage**: Slow
:::

::: {.callout collapse="true"}
#### Original version
## Asymmetric Cryptography
* Also called public cryptography or public key cryptography (1976, W. Diffie & M. Hellman).
* **Idea:** Use two different keys - one **secret** and one **public** - respectively for encryption and decryption operations.
* Each user has a **keyring**.

**Confidentiality:**
* Sender encrypts with the **recipient's public key**.
* Recipient decrypts with their **private key**.
* Only the recipient's key is used!

**Digital Signature:**
* Sender signs with their **private key**.
* Recipient verifies with the **sender's public key**.
* Only the sender's key is used!
* *Note:* Generally sign the **digest** of the document (hash) for performance reasons.

**Signature characteristics:**
* The signature changes if the document changes, while the private key remains the same.
* If the document or signature is modified, verification fails (**integrity guaranteed**).
* It is virtually impossible, even for the holder of the private key, to generate a second document producing the same signature (one-way function **without collisions**).
* Only the holder of the private key can generate a signature verifiable using the corresponding public key (**non-repudiation**).
* **Algorithms**: RSA, ElGamal.
* **Services**: Integrity, Authentication, Non-Repudiation.
* **Slowness**: Up to 50 times slower than symmetric cryptography.
* **Advantage**: No need for a confidential channel to exchange keys (unlike symmetric).
:::


---

## Asymmetric + Symmetric Cryptography (Hybrid)

* **Principle**: Use asymmetric to exchange a symmetric key (session key).
* **Steps**:
  1. A generates a random symmetric key $K_s$.
  2. A encrypts $K_s$ with B's public key.
  3. A and B then communicate using $K_s$ (symmetric).

::: {.callout collapse="true"}
#### Ultra-summary
- **Asymmetric**: exchange of symmetric key.
- **Symmetric**: data encryption.
- **Advantage**: combines security + performance.
:::

::: {.callout collapse="true"}
#### Original version

* **Idea:** Use public cryptography only to exchange symmetric keys (Session keys).
* A generates a random key $K_s$ and transmits it to B by encrypting it with B's public key.
* A & B then communicate using $K_s$ (symmetric).
:::

## Asymmetric Cryptography: Operation (RSA)

### Key Construction
1. **Choice of prime numbers**:
   - $p$ and $q$: two large prime numbers (> 1024 bits)
   - $n = pq$: RSA modulus (size = 2048+ bits)

2. **Calculation of Euler's totient function**:
   - $\phi(n) = (p-1)(q-1)$
   - *Property*: For any $a$ coprime with $n$, $a^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1 \pmod{n}$

3. **Selection of exponents**:
   - $e$: integer coprime with $\phi(n)$ (public exponent)
   - $d$: modular inverse of $e$ (private exponent), such that $ed \equiv 1 \pmod{\phi(n)}$

### Encryption/decryption process
* **Public key**: $(n,e)$
* **Private key**: $(d)$
* **Encryption**: $C = P^e \pmod{n}$
* **Decryption**: $P = C^d \pmod{n}$

### Mathematical proof
1. **Fundamental congruence**:
   - $ed = 1 + k\phi(n)$ (by definition of $d$)

2. **Application of Euler's theorem**:
   - $P^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1 \pmod{n}$ (if $P$ coprime with $n$)

3. **Demonstration**:

   \begin{align*}
   (P^e)^d &\equiv P^{ed} \pmod{n} \\
   &\equiv P^{1 + k\phi(n)} \pmod{n} \\
   &\equiv P \cdot (P^{\phi(n)})^k \pmod{n} \\
   &\equiv P \cdot 1^k \pmod{n} \\
   &\equiv P \pmod{n}
   \end{align*}

### System security
* **Hard problem**: Factorization of $n$ into $p$ and $q$
* **Recommended size**:
  - $n$: 2048 bits (minimum for current security)
  - $p$ and $q$: 1024+ bits each
* **Known vulnerabilities**:
  - Side-channel attacks (timing, power analysis)
  - Inappropriate parameter choices ($e$ too small, $p$ and $q$ too close)

## Asymmetric Cryptography: Operation (RSA)
* Let $n := pq$ with $p$ and $q$ two large prime numbers (> 1024 bits).
* Let $\phi(n) = (p-1)(q-1)$.
* Let $e$ and $d$ such that $ed \equiv 1 \pmod{\phi(n)}$.
* By definition of congruences: $ed = 1 + k\phi(n)$
* Euler's theorem: $a^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1 \pmod n$.
* **Encryption:** $C = P^e \pmod n$. **Public key:** $(n,e)$.
* **Decryption:** $P = C^d \pmod n$. **Private key:** $(d)$.
* *Proof:* $(P^e)^d \equiv P^{ed} \equiv P^{1 + k\phi(n)} \equiv (P \pmod n) (P^{\phi(n)} \pmod n)^k \equiv P \pmod n$.

## Asymmetric Cryptography: Conclusions

* There are a few asymmetric encryption systems (**Rabin**, **ElGamal**, etc.) but the most used is **RSA**.

* **Supported services**: **Confidentiality**, **Authentication**, **Integrity**, **Digital Signature & Non-Repudiation**, (**Non-Duplication**).

* Operations related to **asymmetric cryptography** are up to **50 times (!) slower** than those of **symmetric cryptography**.
  A **combination of the two methods** is often desirable.

* **Key distribution** is simplified by the fact that only **public keys** need to be exchanged between participants (no need for an alternative confidential channel) but…

* … it is necessary to **verify that the public key actually belongs to the recipient**:
  * Either the **acquisition channel** of the public key is protected against any modification (**authenticated**)
  * Or the key is **certified accurate by a third party**

## Symmetric vs Asymmetric Comparison

### Comparative advantages

* **Symmetric**:
  - **Performance**: 100x faster
  - **Implementation**: Easy in hardware
  - **Keys**: Short (128 bits = 16 memorable characters)

* **Asymmetric**:
  - **Key exchange**: Authenticated channel sufficient (no need for confidentiality)
  - **Management**: 1 key pair for n correspondents (vs n keys in symmetric)

### Common issues

* **Weak link**: Key management by users
* **Security basis**: Empirical rather than theoretical
* **Legal constraints**: Usage and export restrictions

## Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Cryptography

* There are **hundreds of symmetric and asymmetric algorithms** capable of providing a sufficient level of **confidentiality**.

* **Symmetric solutions** offer the following advantages:
  * **Speed** (up to **100 times faster** than asymmetric solutions)
  * **Ease of hardware implementation**
  * **Reduced key length**: **128 bits** (= 16 characters ⇒ memorable!) instead of **1024 bits** for asymmetric equivalents.

* **Asymmetric solutions** have as main arguments:
  * **Simplified key exchange**: keys must be exchanged through an **authenticated but non-confidential channel**
  * **Simplified key management**: a single **public/private key pair** is sufficient for a user to receive confidential messages from **n users** (instead of **n different keys** in the symmetric case).

* **Problems common to both techniques**:
  * **Key management by the user** remains the **weakest link**
  * Security (normally) based on **empirical arguments** rather than **theoretical** ones
  * **Legal restrictions** on usage and export

# Dissection of an Attack: Ransomware

### Definition and Impact
* **Definition**: Malicious software that encrypts data and demands a ransom for its restoration.
* **Limitations of the classic definition**:
  - Does not cover the impact on **critical infrastructure** (e.g., Colonial Pipeline, May 2021)
  - Underestimates the **systemic scope** of attacks
* **Alarming statistics**:
  - Billions of annual attacks
  - Considered the **most dangerous cyber threat** in 2021 ("Ransomware Everywhere")

::: {.callout collapse="true"}
#### Ultra-summary
- **Malware**: Encrypts data → demands ransom
- **Impact**: Critical infrastructure (e.g., Colonial Pipeline)
- **Threat #1** in cybersecurity (2021)
- **Targets**: Individuals + businesses + states
:::

::: {.callout collapse="true"}
#### Original version
"Ransomware (from English **ransomware**), ransom software, extortion software, is malicious software that holds personal data hostage. To do this, ransomware **encrypts personal data** then asks their owner to send money in exchange for the **decryption key**" (Wikipedia September 21, 2021).

- **Incomplete definition** because **ransomware** affects a **vast spectrum of IT infrastructure**

- For example, in May 2021, a **ransomware attack** against the **Colonial Pipeline** company caused a **fuel supply disruption** for a large part of the US coast

- With a **total number of attacks** counted in **billions per year**, "**Ransomware Everywhere**" is globally considered the **most direct, visible and dangerous threat** for users and companies in 2021!

# Basic Cryptography Concepts

* Introduction to the **fundamental concepts** of cryptography.
* Presents **security principles**, **system types**, and **attack models**.
* Includes **historical systems** and complementary techniques.

## Kerckhoffs' Principle

* Fundamental principle: **security relies solely on the key**, not on the secrecy of the algorithm.
* The system must remain **secure even if the algorithm is public**.
* The key must be **easily modifiable** and the system **simple to use**.
* Explicit rejection of **security through obscurity**.

::: {.callout collapse="true"}
#### Ultra-summary
- Security based on the key
- Public algorithm
- No security through obscurity
:::

::: {.callout collapse="true"}
#### Original version
## Kerckhoffs' Principle

**Auguste Kerckhoffs** published in **1883** two articles defining **six principles** for military ciphers:

1. The system must be **practically, if not mathematically, undecipherable**.
2. It must **not require confidentiality** and remain secure even if it falls into enemy hands.
3. The **key** must be able to be **memorized, transmitted and modified easily**, without written notes.
4. The system must be **compatible with telegraphic communications**.
5. It must be **portable** and usable by **a single person**.
6. It must be **simple to use**, without complex procedures or excessive constraints.

Kerckhoffs stated as early as the **19th century** that security must be **mathematically demonstrable** and that **there is no security through obscurity**.
:::

## Classification of Encryption Systems

### Unconditional Security

(*unconditional security* / *perfect secrecy*)

* Security **independent of computing power**.
* **Ciphertext** provides no information about the **plaintext**.
* Conditions: **key ≥ message**, **never reused**.
* Mostly **theoretical** use.
* **Example**: *one-time pad*.

### As hard as / equivalent / provable security

* Cryptanalysis **as difficult** as a **hard mathematical problem**.
* **RSA** and **Rabin** proven equivalent to factorization.
  * Demonstrated by **reduction** (*reduction proof*).
* Central but **controversial** concept.

### Computational Security

(*computational security* / *practical security*)

* Security based on **unrealistic cost of attacks**.
* Most used category in practice.
* **Examples**: **AES**, **DES**, **IDEA**, **RC4**.

::: {.callout collapse="true"}

#### Ultra-summary

* **Unconditional**: perfect, theoretical (*one-time pad*).
* **Provable security**: equivalence to hard mathematical problem.
* **Computational**: secure in practice.
:::

::: {.callout collapse="true"}

#### Original version

* **Unconditional security** (*unconditional security also called **perfect secrecy***):

  * The security of the encryption system **is not compromised by the computing power** intended for cryptanalysis.
  * This category relies on **information theory** published by **Shannon in 1949**.
  * More precisely, an encryption system is **unconditionally secure** if the probability of encountering a **plaintext x** after observing the **corresponding ciphertext y** is identical to the a priori probability of encountering plaintext x.
  * In other words, having **plaintext/ciphertext pairs (x,y)** provides **no help for cryptanalysis**.
  * A necessary condition for a system to be unconditionally secure is that the **key be at least the same size as the message** and, above all, that it **not be reused** to encrypt different messages.
  * This condition makes these systems **poorly suited to usual cryptographic needs** and reduces their domain of interest to a **theoretical framework**.
  * The classic example is the **one-time pad** invented in **1917** by **J. Mauborgne** and **G. Vernam**.
  * Theoretical foundations of unconditionally secure systems + other examples in **[Sti06]**.

* **As hard as / equivalent / provable security**

  * When it can be proven that cryptanalyzing the algorithm is **as difficult as solving a reputedly hard mathematical problem**.
  * For example **factorization of large numbers**, calculation of **square roots modulo a composite**, calculation of **discrete logarithms in a finite group**, etc.
  * The **Rabin** and **RSA** algorithms (generic case^1) are "proven" **equivalent to factorization**.
  * Such a proof is called a "reduction" (**reduction proof**).
  * The notion of **provable security** is at the origin of an **important controversy** in the cryptographic world.

* **Computational security** (*computational security also called **practical security***)

  * An encryption system is in this category if the **computational effort needed to "break" it** using the best possible techniques is **beyond** (with a reasonable margin) the computing resources of a hypothetical adversary.
  * The vast majority of symmetric encryption systems (**AES, DES, IDEA, RC4**, etc.) are in this category.
:::

## Entropy

* **Entropy** (Shannon, 1948) measures the **effective amount of information** contained in a message.
* **Conditional entropy** measures the uncertainty that remains about the **plaintext** after observing the **ciphertext**.

### Properties

* $0 \le H(X) \le \log n$
* $H(X) = 0$ → no uncertainty
* $H(X) = \log n$ → all outcomes equally probable

### Interpretation

* Approximates the **number of bits needed** to encode $X$.
* **Redundancy** = difference between effective encoding and entropy.

### Conditional Entropy

* $H(X \mid Y = y) = - \sum_{x} P(X=x \mid Y=y) \log P(X=x \mid Y=y)$
* $H(X \mid Y) = \sum_y P(Y=y) H(X \mid Y=y)$
* Measures the remaining uncertainty about the **plaintext** after observing the **ciphertext**.

#### Ultra-summary

* **Entropy**: amount of information in a message.
* **Conditional entropy**: uncertainty about plaintext after ciphertext.
* **Redundancy**: difference between effective encoding and entropy.
:::

::: {.callout collapse="true"}

#### Original version

* An essential definition in cryptography is the **effective** amount of information contained in a message.
* For example, days of the week (*Monday*, ..., *Sunday*) can intuitively be encoded as character strings of length ($\le \text{len}(\text{``Wednesday''})$), i.e., $(8 \times 8 = 64)$ bits. However, the effective amount of information of the variable *day of the week* can be optimally encoded on **3 bits** (since $(2^3 = 8)$ is sufficient to represent the 7 possible variations).
* **Entropy** (Shannon, 1948) is the mathematical formalization of this definition.

### Formal Definition

Let $X$ be a random variable with a finite set of possible values ${x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n}$, such that $P(X=x_i) = p_i$, with $0 \le p_i \le 1$ and $\sum p_i = 1$.
The entropy of $X$, denoted $H(X)$, is defined by

$H(X) = - \sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i \log p_i = \sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i \log \left(\frac{1}{p_i}\right)$

By convention: $p_i \log p_i = 0$ if $p_i = 0$. All logarithms are in **base 2**.

### Interpretation

* Approximation of the number of bits needed to encode the elements of $X$.
* **Redundancy** is the difference between the effective encoding and entropy.

### Properties

1. $0 \le H(X) \le \log n$
2. $H(X) = 0 \iff \exists i : p_i = 1, p_j = 0 \ \forall j \ne i$
3. $H(X) = \log n \iff p_i = 1/n \ \forall i$

### Conditional Entropy

* $H(X \mid Y = y) = - \sum_{x} P(X=x \mid Y=y) \log P(X=x \mid Y=y)$,
* $H(X \mid Y) = \sum_y P(Y=y) H(X \mid Y=y)$

*Measures the uncertainty about $X$ (plaintext) after having observed $Y$ (ciphertext).*

## Attacks on Encryption Systems

* **Ciphertext-only**: Adversary has only the **ciphertext**.
* **Known-plaintext**: Adversary has **plaintext/ciphertext pairs**.
* **Chosen-plaintext**: Adversary **chooses** the **plaintext** and see the ciphertext (and tries to find the plaintext for other messages).
* **Adaptive chosen-plaintext**: **depends on** the **received** ciphertexts.
* **Chosen-ciphertext**: Adversary **chooses** the **ciphertext** and obtains the plaintext (aims to find the key).
* **Adaptive Chosen-ciphertext**: **Chosen-ciphertext** depends on the received plaintexts.

## Oracles and Security Models

### Random Oracles and Security Models

* **Random Oracle**: A theoretical "perfect" function that returns a uniform and random value for each new input, but remains deterministic for an input already seen.
* **ROM (Random Oracle Model)**: Mathematical proof framework using this ideal oracle as a substitute for hash functions.
* **Standard Model**: Framework where security relies solely on the adversary's computing power against real algorithms.
* **Limit**: A security proof in ROM does not guarantee absolute security in the real world (with SHA-256, etc.).

::: {.callout collapse="true"}
#### Original version
A **random oracle** is an abstract entity accessible to legitimate parties and adversaries.

* **Behavior**: It responds to input queries $x$ with perfectly random responses $Orc(x)$. 
* **Determinism**: The only exception lies in previously processed inputs ($x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$). If $x_1' = x_1$, then $Orc(x_1') = Orc(x_1)$.
* **Modeling**: It is modeled by a function $Orc : X \to Y$ where $\forall x \in X, \Pr(Orc(x) = y) = \frac{1}{|Y|}$.
* **Utility**: It behaves like an **"ideal" cryptographic hash function**, a valuable tool for proving security in the **Random Oracle Model**. 
* **Comparison**: The **standard model** limits adversaries by computational factors. A protocol secure in the random oracle model can become vulnerable if used with a "real" hash function (SHA-1, SHA-256).

### Encryption, Decryption and Signature Oracles

* **Function**: Entities that perform operations (encrypt/sign) for the adversary using secret keys without ever revealing them.
* **Symmetric cryptography**: The oracle provides $E_k(x)$ or $D_k(y)$.
* **Asymmetric cryptography**: The oracle is crucial for private operations (decryption/signature), as public operations are already freely accessible.

::: {.callout collapse="true"}
#### Original version: Operational Oracles
An **encryption/decryption/signature oracle** is an abstract entity offering an "on-demand" service.

* **Key access**: It uses the **same keys as the legitimate owners** (symmetric and asymmetric systems) without disclosing them.
* **Symmetric primitives**: For a primitive $E$ and a key $k$, it returns $y = E_k(x)$ or the corresponding plaintext $x$.
* **Public key systems**: The oracle is only needed for operations with the **private key** ($priv_k$).
    * **Decryption**: returns $x$ such that $E'_{pubk}(x) = y$.
    * **Signature**: For a system $S$, it returns $y = S_{privk}(x)$.
* **Attacks**: The attack models using **chosen plaintext** (CPA) and **chosen ciphertext** (CCA) rely on making these oracles available to the adversary.

### Indistinguishability and Semantic Security (IND-CPA)

* **Property**: An adversary must not be able to distinguish the ciphertexts of two different plaintext messages.
* **IND-CPA (Indistinguishability under Chosen Plaintext Attack)**: If the adversary guesses the correct message only with a probability of $1/2 + \epsilon$, the system is considered secure.
* **Semantic Security**: Equivalent to IND-CPA, it ensures that no useful information leaks from the ciphertext.

::: {.callout collapse="true"}
#### Original version: Semantic Security
**Ciphertext indistinguishability** guarantees the inability to distinguish the ciphertexts of given plaintexts.

* **Experiment (IND-CPA Security Game)**:
    1. The adversary chooses two messages $M_0$ and $M_1$.
    2. The oracle chooses a random index $i \in \{0,1\}$ and returns $c_i = E_k(M_i)$.
    3. The adversary can perform other calculations or oracle calls.
* **IND-CPA Definition**: The system is secure if the adversary's advantage is **negligible** ($Prob = 1/2 + \epsilon$ with $\epsilon$ small).
* **Note**: In public key, the encryption oracle is useless because the adversary already possesses the public key. IND-CPA provides **semantic security**.

### Probabilistic Encryption and OAEP

* **Problem**: Deterministic encryption allows **dictionary attacks** (comparison of known ciphertexts).
* **Solution**: Add randomness to the message before encryption so that $E(M)$ is different each time.
* **OAEP (Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding)**: Standard used with RSA. It combines the message $P$ with a random number $R$ via hash functions $h$ and XOR operations ($\oplus$).

::: {.callout collapse="true"}
#### Original version: Determinism vs. Probabilism
**Deterministic** behavior (same inputs = same outputs) creates vulnerabilities.

* **Example**: If Alice sends "Yes" or "No", the adversary can compute $C_{yes} = E_{pub}(``Yes")$ and compare. They can create a **codebook** (dictionary) to identify messages without breaking the key.
* **Probabilistic encryption**: Adds randomness. The goal is semantic security for the public key.
* **OAEP**: Used in **RSA-PKCS1**. The text $P$ is combined with randomness $R$:
    * $M_1 := P \oplus h(R)$
    * $M_2 := R \oplus h(M_1)$
    * Encryption applies to $M_1$ and $M_2$. During decryption, we recover $R = M_2 \oplus h(M_1)$, then $P = h(R) \oplus M_1$.

## History of Cryptography and Unconditional Security

### Historical Encryption Systems

Cryptography was for a long time limited to the sole pursuit of **confidentiality**. Historical systems are based on two fundamental principles: **substitution** and **transposition**.

* **Caesar Cipher** (mono-alphabetic substitution): Fixed letter shift. Very vulnerable to **frequency analysis**.
* **Vigenère Cipher** (polyalphabetic substitution): Uses a key to vary the shift. More complex, but breakable by identifying the key length.
* **Transposition Cipher**: Reorganization of the original text characters according to a permutation defined by a key.

::: {.callout collapse="true"}
#### Original version: Historical Cryptography
For centuries **confidentiality** was the only application of cryptography...

* **1st century BC, Caesar Cipher**: **Mono-alphabetic substitution encryption** $e_k(x) = (x + k) \pmod{26}$, $d_k(y) = (y - k) \pmod{26}$ where $x, y, k \in \mathbb{Z}_{26}$.
    * Example: $E_1(\text{'hello'}) = \text{'ifmmp'}$.
    * **Cryptanalysis**: easy, based on **character frequency**.
* **16th century, Vigenère**: **Polyalphabetic substitution encryption** $e_k(x_1, \dots, x_n) = (x_1 + k_1, \dots, x_m + k_m, x_{m+1} + k_1, \dots) \pmod{26}$.
    * **Cryptanalysis**: find the **key length $m$** by identifying repeated ciphertext portions and analyzing separate blocks as in the Caesar Cipher.
* **Transposition Ciphers** (Porta, 1563): The key defines a **permutation** on the plaintext.
* These techniques are still the basis of modern encryption systems (ex: **Enigma**, qualified by W. Churchill as the secret weapon that won the war).
:::

### The One-Time Pad (OTP)

The **One-Time Pad** (OTP), or **Vernam cipher**, is the only system proven to be **unconditionally secure** (perfect secrecy).

* **Principle**: The message is combined with a key of the same length via the XOR operation ($\oplus$).
* **Unconditional Security**: Observation of the encrypted message provides no information about the plaintext message. Even an adversary with infinite computing power cannot break it.
* **Shannon's Constraints**: The key must be **as long as the message**, purely **random**, and **used only once**.
* **Key Reuse**: If a key is reused for two messages, an attacker can eliminate the key by XOR ($y_a \oplus y_b = x_a \oplus x_b$) and recover the plaintext messages.

::: {.callout collapse="true"}
#### Original version: The One-Time Pad
Let $n \ge 1$ and the spaces $P, C, K$ such that $P, C, K = (\mathbb{Z}_2)^n$. The encryption and decryption operations of a **one-time pad** (Vernam Cipher) are:
$E_k(x_i) = x_i \oplus k_i$ and $D_k(y_i) = y_i \oplus k_i$ for $1 \le i \le n$.

* **Unconditional security**: If $k_i$ are random and independent, observation of ciphertexts does not help cryptanalysis. The **entropy** of $X$ does not decrease: $H(X|C) = H(X)$.
* **Shannon's Theorem**: Necessary condition: $H(K) \ge H(X)$. The length of the **random key** must be at least as large as that of the plaintext.
* **Key reuse**: $y_a \oplus y_b = x_a \oplus x_b$. With low-entropy messages, the plaintexts and the key ($k = y_a \oplus x_a$) can be recovered.
* Vulnerable to the **Known Plaintext** attack (if the key is reused).
* Major problem: The **distribution and management** of large keys. Revived by **quantum cryptography** proposing confidential channels for unlimited-length key distribution.
:::

### Steganography

In contrast to cryptography, which makes the message unreadable, **steganography** conceals the very existence of the message.

* **Method**: Use a "subliminal channel" (an innocent medium like an image or a banal text).
* **Modern technique**: Insertion of data into the **least significant bits** (LSB) of multimedia files, allowing the hiding of large volumes of data without visible alteration.

::: {.callout collapse="true"}
#### Original version: Steganography
**Steganography** hides a message inside another. Constituent elements:

1. A different **physical or logical channel** (subliminal channel).
2. A **secret mechanism** to identify this channel.

* **Classic examples**: First letters of words in a text, invisible ink.
* **Modern example**: Use the **least significant bits** of the frames of a Photo CD.
* For a 2048x3072 image (RGB 24 bits), hiding a message using 1 bit allows storing **2.3 Mb** without deteriorating quality.
